**Automation Functional Testing for Insurance Quote Web Application**

**Objective:**
The objective of this assignment was to perform system testing on a prototype of a browser-based Web application using Selenium Web Driver and NUnit. 
The application is designed to determine insurance eligibility and provide insurance quotes based on the user's age, driving experience, and number of accidents.

**Deliverables:**
**Decision Tables:** Developed three decision tables based on the provided business requirements. 
The decision tables listed all possible combinations, properly showed "don't care" situations, and presented a reduced set of columns for clarity.
**Derived Test Cases:** Derived test cases from the third decision table in a tabular format. Each test case included a Test ID, Test Steps, and Expected Outcomes.
**Selenium Web Driver Tests:** Created fifteen system test cases using Selenium Web Driver and NUnit. The tests covered all specified scenarios, including the nine mandatory tests and six additional unique tests.
